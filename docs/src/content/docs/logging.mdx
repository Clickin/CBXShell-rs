## Quick answer

- **Log file:** `%TEMP%\\cbxshell_debug.log`
- **Best tool:** `Get-Content ... -Wait` to tail in PowerShell
- **Use case:** Troubleshooting thumbnail generation and archive parsing

CBXShell writes debug logs to a temp file for troubleshooting:

```cmd
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp\cbxshell_debug.log
```

Tail logs in PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-Content "$env:TEMP\cbxshell_debug.log" -Wait
```
