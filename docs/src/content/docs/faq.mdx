## Quick answer

- **Thumbnails not showing:** Restart Explorer, clear thumbnail cache, confirm CBXShell is registered.
- **Archives not supported:** Confirm format is ZIP/RAR/7z or `.cbz/.cbr/.cb7`.
- **WebP/AVIF issues:** Update to the latest release and check logs.
- **Need logs:** `%TEMP%\\cbxshell_debug.log`

## Thumbnails are not showing in Explorer

**Short fix:** Restart Explorer and clear the thumbnail cache.

1. Close Explorer (`taskkill /f /im explorer.exe`)
2. Restart Explorer (`start explorer.exe`)
3. If needed, clear the thumbnail cache in Windows settings.

See [Installation](/installation/) for registration steps and [Logging](/logging/) for diagnostics.

## Only some archive files show thumbnails

**Short fix:** Confirm the archive contains supported image formats and is not encrypted.

- Supported archives: `.cbz/.cbr/.cb7`, ZIP, RAR, 7z
- Supported images: JPEG/PNG/GIF/BMP/TIFF/ICO + WebP + AVIF

If a specific archive fails, check the log for decoding errors.

## WebP/AVIF thumbnails are missing or slow

**Short fix:** Update to the latest release and verify the archive entries are valid images.

WebP/AVIF decoding depends on the `image` crate and can fail with corrupted files.
Check `%TEMP%\\cbxshell_debug.log` for decoder errors.

## How do I unregister CBXShell manually?

**Short fix:** Run `regsvr32 /u cbxshell.dll` from an elevated command prompt.

See [Installation](/installation/) for the full manual install and uninstall steps.
