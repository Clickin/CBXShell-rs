CBXShell is a modern Windows shell extension that renders high-quality thumbnails
for comic book archives (`.cbz`, `.cbr`, `.cb7`) and common ZIP/RAR/7z archives that
contain images.

It is a Rust reimplementation of the original C++ CBXShell project by T800
Productions, focused on Windows 11 compatibility, modern image formats, and
memory safety.

## Highlights

- Native Windows thumbnail handler via `IThumbnailProvider`
- Stream-based archive processing with `IInitializeWithStream`
- WebP and AVIF decode support
- High-quality resizing with `fast_image_resize`
- Configurable sorting and handler management via the manager app
